This depicts the what would happen if HTML, CSS and DOM comes together.
You can easily signup using your credentials and then login using the registered credentials.
The above mentioned functionality is achieved by keeping and manipulating the user data using the browser's local storage.
You can also sort the movies on the basis of their IMDB rating in low to high or in high to low fashion.
The functionality mentioned in point number 5 is achieved by DOM manipulation.

Hope you guys will like this small project of mine, many more to come in future.
